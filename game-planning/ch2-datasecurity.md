** Chapter 2: The Data Dilemma - Protecting Techville’s Secrets**

**Learning Goals:**

- Help the Guardians understand the importance of personal data protection and privacy.
- Teach best practices like strong passwords, encryption, and recognizing phishing to defend Techville's data.
- Show how these concepts fit into their broader journey as AI Guardians.

**Context:**

The Guardians have already completed Chapter 1: The Awakening, where they learned the basics of AI and its impact on daily life. Now, they face their next challenge: protecting the personal data of Techville’s citizens from a data breach in the Data Privacy Wing of the Techville Museum.

**Page 1: The Data Breach Alarm!**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator (Guardian Leader): “Guardians, a data breach has occurred in the museum’s Data Privacy Wing! Hackers have stolen personal data from our citizens. We must act fast to prevent more leaks!”
Narrator: “Your mission is to learn how to protect Techville’s most important secrets, starting with mastering passwords.”

**Visuals/Actions:**

The Data Privacy Wing alarm goes off, and the player’s avatar rushes in with the Guardians.
Visual of a vault door left open by weak passwords, with hackers sneaking around.
**Page 2: What’s a Password and Why Is It Important for Guardians?**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "Passwords are your first line of defense against hackers. They lock the vaults holding important data. But weak passwords let hackers in too easily!"
Narrator: "Let’s see how weak passwords like '1234' can be easily guessed. You’ll need stronger ones to protect Techville’s secrets."

**Visuals/Actions:**

Show a hacker typing "1234" or "password" and breaking into a vault.
Hacker tries "FluffyDragon!45" and fails to get in. A locked vault animation demonstrates protection.
**Page 3: Building Strong Passwords**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: “Guardians need passwords that are impossible to guess. The stronger the password, the harder it is for hackers to break in.”
Narrator: “To build a strong password, use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, and make it at least 8 characters long.”

**Visuals/Actions:**

Display weak passwords like "dog123" vs. strong ones like "Lightning$Horse99."
Show a password strength meter filling up as complex characters are added.

**Activity:**

Drag-and-drop letters, numbers, and symbols to create a strong password.
Real-time feedback as the password improves.
**Page 4: The Rules for Guardian Passwords**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "A Guardian’s password follows these rules:"
At least 8 characters.
A mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
No personal info (name, birthday).
Different passwords for each vault (account).

**Visuals/Actions:**

Checklist with visual examples of each rule.
A vault locks up tighter as the password follows each rule.
**Page 5: Protecting Multiple Vaults (Password Uniqueness)**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "Techville’s vaults hold lots of data. Each vault needs a unique password, so if one is breached, the others stay safe!"
Activity:

Matching Game: The player matches passwords to different vaults (accounts) like "school account," "game login," or "city data."
**Visuals/Actions:**

Vaults opening only when matched with strong, unique passwords.

**Page 6: The Password Hacking Simulation**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "Let’s see how hackers try to guess passwords. We’ll test how well your password holds up."

**Visuals/Actions:**

Show the simulation of how hackers try to guess weak passwords:
Check numbers (e.g., "123456").
Check dictionary words (e.g., "password").
Common patterns (e.g., "password123").
The player gets feedback on their chosen password’s strength.
**Page 7: Defend Techville’s Data (Password Defender Game)**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "Hackers are actively trying to break into the Data Privacy Wing’s vaults. Build strong passwords quickly to stop them!"
Activity:

A drag-and-drop game where players create strong passwords while defending against hackers trying to breach Techville’s vaults.
Points for every strong password built in time.
**Page 8: Encryption - Protecting Data in Code**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "Passwords protect vaults, but for extra security, Guardians use encryption to scramble data so hackers can’t read it."

**Visuals/Actions:**

Guardians explain encryption, showing data being scrambled into code.
Activity:

Encryption Puzzle: Solve a simple cipher to decrypt a message and protect Techville’s data.
**Page 9: Recognizing Phishing (Phishing Detective Game)**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "Hackers use phishing to trick Guardians into giving away passwords. Can you spot the fake messages?"
Activity:

Messages from both legitimate and phishing senders, with pop-ups explaining phishing signs.
**Page 10: Mission Complete - You’re a Data Privacy Guardian!**

**Dialogue:**

Narrator: "Congratulations, Guardian! You’ve defended Techville’s data by mastering password security, encryption, and phishing recognition."

**Activity:**

Final quiz to reinforce key lessons (password strength, encryption, phishing).
Player earns a Data Privacy Guardian certificate to mark their achievement.
