// Objective: Explain how AI uses patterns in data to make decisions.

// Visuals: Demonstrations of pattern recognition, like facial recognition or analyzing weather data.
// Action:
// Players guide an AI system to recognize patterns in sets of data, such as identifying faces in a crowd or trends in shopping data.
