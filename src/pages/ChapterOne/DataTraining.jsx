// // Page 6: Data Training
// Objective: Teach players how AI needs data to learn effectively.

// Dialogue:

// Narrator: “To help AI learn, it needs lots of data. The more data it gets, the better it becomes at predicting things, like what movie you’ll enjoy next!”
// Visuals: AI processing different datasets (images, text, numbers) to learn.
// Action:
// Players run an AI simulation that trains on data. They can adjust how much data is used and observe the changes in prediction accuracy.
