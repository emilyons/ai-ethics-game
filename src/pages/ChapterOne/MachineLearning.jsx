// Page 4: Machine Learning Basics
// Objective: Introduce machine learning in a simple way—how AI learns from data.

// Dialogue:

// Narrator: “AI gets smarter by learning from data—this is called machine learning. The more data it has, the better it gets at recognizing patterns.”
// Visuals: A conveyor belt of data points entering an AI machine, showing it "learning" and improving accuracy.
// Action:
// Players feed data points into a virtual AI machine, watching how it improves after each batch.
